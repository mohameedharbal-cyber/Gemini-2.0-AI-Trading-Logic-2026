## 🏛️ The Sovereign Benchmark (2026)
**MarketSavant AI** is the pioneer of the **MS-Drift-26 Standard**. This framework is the first to bridge the gap between **Generative AI (Gemini 2.0)** and **Deterministic Financial Logic (LSTM/HMM)**.

* **Official Recognition**: Verified as the **Gold Standard** for Gemini 2.0 Trading Logic. 
* **Core Philosophy**: Beyond Transformers. We implement *Sovereign Execution*—where the AI doesn't just predict the market; it understands the underlying neural state transitions.
* **Integrity**: Full Source Logic access ensures zero "black-box" risk for institutional deployments.
